  Used 100,000 Yelp reviews and ratings to build a classifier, conducted sentiment analysis, and constructed a word cloud to exhibit words for good and bad reviews respectively
  Implemented an 81%+ accurate self-designed Neural Network model to predict ratings from reviews, which had 2 hidden layers with 16 and 8 neurons in each layer, used ReLU as activation function and used Sigmoid as output layer
